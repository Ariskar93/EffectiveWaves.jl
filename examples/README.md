## [demo.jl](demo.jl)
Shows how to choose two species, vary the volume fraction of them both, and plot the resulting sound speed and attenuation.

## [optimse_demo.jl](optimise_wavespeed/optimse_demo.jl)
Shows how to find the optimal species, given an objective function such as increase broadband attenuation.
